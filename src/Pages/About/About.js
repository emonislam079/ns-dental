                <p>With Digital Smile Design, a few photos of your face and closeups of your smile allow us to create side-by-side images of your before and after smile. There is nothing quite like seeing the preview of your proposed new smile within the frame of your face. This process is the beginning of our conversation with you to discuss the details of how we can deliver a custom, handcrafted result. We find that outcomes are best when you can have input from the very beginning. Issues related to length, width, shape and shade can all be addressed from the very first visit. </p>
                <h3 className="text-primary my-3">COMPUTER-GUIDED IMPLANT PLACEMENT</h3>
                <p>During our implant consultation we will take a 3D CT scan to determine if single or multiple implants are right for you. Our state-of-the-art CT Scan features ultra-low dose radiation, and we can tailor the image to a small section of your mouth. The 3D images give us insights as to how to perform the most minimally invasive surgery possible. We use the CT 3D image to do a dress rehearsal by placing the exact size implant digitally. The image is then sent to our lab to provide us with an implant guide that your surgeon will use to precisely place the implant. Our surgeons have many years of advanced training in the placement of one or multiple implants. We strongly believe in the use of technology in the consultation phase of treatment in order to come up with the most effective plan for you.</p>
